# WebGL

## Presenting: The worlds most complicated square

### Running locally
- `npm install`
- `npx tsc --watch`
- Navigate to `index.html` in your browser

### Notes
- A `PARAM:` in the comments marks a variable that can be tweaked to produce interesting values, such as how the shape is drawn, the colour, the size/orientation, the coordinates, etc

### TODO
- Probably webpack to prevent the `ts-ignore`s where an imported package is used
- Front end to tweak the values?
- Could even be a react app
